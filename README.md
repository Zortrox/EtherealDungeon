# EtherealDungeon
A simple rogue-like game I made.  Biggest feature is you can ghost through walls.

# About
This is just to showcase this game and let anybody edit as they wish.  It started as a school project and turned into a little more fun.  You can edit as you wish.  You don't have to credit me, but it'd be nice.
